msgid "If your company does business with residents of the EU – whether or not they are paying customers and whether or not they are citizens of an EU country – or collects or processes the personal information of EU residents, collect or give out business cards, email lists, or even just tracks their web-browsing habits with cookies, it’s likely the GDPR applies.All U.S. businesses need to pay attention to the new and comprehensive EU-wide privacy law known as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which takes effect on May 25, 2018. With its greatly expanded compliance obligations, tough penalty regime (fines can be as much as 4% of a company’s worldwide gross revenue), and extra-territorial applicability, even businesses licensed to sell only in the U.S., and with no operations in the EU whatsoever, may nonetheless find that they are subject to the jurisdiction of GDPR.Continuing to service policies sold in the US to customers who later moved to the EU, for example, may raise issues regarding whether the company’s activities bring it within the jurisdiction of the GDPR, which is designed to protect the personal data of individuals in the EU, regardless of nationality."
